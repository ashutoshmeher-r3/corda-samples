# QueryableState CorDapp

This CorDapp demonstrates QueryableState works in Corda. Corda allows developers
to have the ability to expose some or all parts of their states to a custom database
table using an ORM tools. To support this feature the state must implement 
`QueryableState`.

In this CorDapp we would use an `Insurance` state and persist its properties in a 
custom table in the database.  The `Insurance` state among other fields also 
contains an `VehicleDetail` object, which is the asset being insured. We have used 
this `VehicleDetail` to demonstrate _One-to-One_ relationship. Similarly we also 
have a list of `Claim` objects in the `Insurance` state which represents claims 
made against the insurance. We use them to demonstrate _One-to-Many_ relationship.

## Pre-requisites:
See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.

## Running the nodes:
 
See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

There are two flow in this cordapp:
1. IssueInsuranceInitiator: It creates the insurance state with the associated vehicle
information.
2. InsuranceClaimInitiator: It creates the claims against the insurance.

A spring boot client is provided with the cordapp, which exposes two REST endpoints 
(see `Controller` in the clients module) to trigger the flows. 
Use the command `./gradlew bootRun` in the project root folder to run the Spring Boot
Server.

The Postman collection containing API's calls to the REST endpoints can be imported 
from the link: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ddc01c13b8ab4b5e853b. 
Use the option Import > Import from Link option in Postman to import the collection.

## Connecting to the Database
The JDBC url to connect to the database would be printed in the console in node 
startup. Use the url to connect to the database using a suitable client. The 
default username is 'sa' and password is '' (blank).
